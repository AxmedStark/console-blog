# Console Blog Application

This is implementation of some social blogging application, but for now it is only for local usage. In the future this app will be refactored.

## What is this app supposed to do right now?

* Allow user to create his/her own account with username and password (there is one user added (username: 'vaqif', password: '1') for testing purpose. NOTE: However, it is now allowed to set a password with length less than 8 symbols!)
* Allow user to log in to his/her account and see other users' posts
* Read, create, update, delete his/her own posts

## What is this app created for?

At this point I am new to Python, but I have already worked with other languages. 
I wrote this code in order to understand for myself the logic which web applications rely to. As you will see, I am somehow close to right implementation. Of course this code is not considered to be perfect right now.

### Note

* There is no way to keep your data after terminating the app yet.
